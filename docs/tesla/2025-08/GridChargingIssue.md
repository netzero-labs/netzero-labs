# Grid Charging Issue

As of August 5, 2025, there is an ongoing issue on Tesla's side with Grid Charging configuration.

Any attempt to change the Grid Charging setting to On or Off will fail. This affects Netzero automations
as well as manual configuration changes in both the Tesla and Netzero apps.
*Note: You may need to restart the Tesla app to see the Grid Charging value reset.*

Automations that include Grid Charging actions will fail with a
**"Failed to apply configuration changes"** error. Other actions in the automation will still run successfully.

We have notified Tesla of this issue and will share updates as we receive them.
