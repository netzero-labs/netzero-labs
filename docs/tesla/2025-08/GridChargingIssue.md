# Grid Charging Issue

As of Aug 5 2025, there is an ongoing issue on Tesla's side with Grid Charging configuration.

Any configuration changing Grid Charging to On or Off will fail. This will affect Netzero automations
and manual configuration changes, in both Tesla and Netzero apps. Note: you might need to restart the
Tesla app to see the Grid Charging value getting reset.

Automations that include Grid Charging actions will fail with a
"Failed to apply configuration changes" error. Note that any other actions as part of the automation
will run successfully.

We notified Tesla of this issue and will send updates as we have them.
