# Update: Funding Netzero with Subscriptions

## Quick Summary

Starting **August 1, 2025**, a subscription will be required to access advanced
[Netzero](https://www.netzero.energy) features such as automations, dynamic tariffs, utility
integrations, and diagnostics. USD pricing is **$6.99/month** or **$69.99/year** (a 16% discount).
Local pricing will vary by currency and VAT: [Pricing details](https://www.netzero.energy/pricing).

Read on to learn why we are introducing subscriptions, how Netzero can save you more than the cost
of a subscription, and the future improvements this change will support.


## Netzero's Journey So Far

Netzero has been free to use for its first two years. It began as a
better Powerwall dashboard with solar estimates and diagnostic insights. Since then, it has grown
to include:

- Automations
- Dynamic tariffs and utility integrations
- EV integrations and Charge on Solar
- Powerwall 3 support and diagnostics
- Health monitoring
- Improved solar forecasting

This growth has come with increased infrastructure and development costs. All automations run in
the cloud, and Tesla now charges for vehicle API access, further increasing operating expenses.


## How Netzero Helps You Save

Netzero was designed not just to complement the Tesla app, but to solve problems Tesla left
unaddressed:

- **Greater control over Powerwall behavior:**
  Tesla's Self-Powered and Time-Based Control modes offer limited flexibility. Netzero lets you
  adapt to increasingly complex utility rate plans through custom automations, saving on utility
  bills in the process.

- **Integration with smarter utility rate plans:**
  Netzero supports dynamic tariffs (e.g. Octopus Energy, Tibber, ComEd, Amber Electric). Users on
  Intelligent Octopus Go save up to £80/month by charging their Powerwall during low-cost periods.

- **Smarter EV and battery coordination:**
  Features like Charge on Solar for non-Tesla EVs and prevention of Powerwall discharge during EV
  charging reduce grid use and lower bills.

- **Diagnostics that catch expensive issues:**
  Netzero's diagnostics helped many users secure warranty replacements for degrading
  Powerwalls, often worth thousands of dollars. Tesla's app does not expose this data.

- **Early detection of solar or Powerwall failures:**
  Over 10% of Netzero users have received actionable alerts for issues like complete solar
  production loss or a non-functional Powerwall.


## What Subscriptions Will Fund

Subscriptions will help sustain and accelerate Netzero's development. Our long-term
vision—-Intelligent Home Energy Management—-extends beyond solar and batteries to include:

- Electric vehicles
- Heat pumps
- Deeper utility integration
- Smarter coordination of home energy systems

As renewable generation grows and demand from EVs and electric homes increases, utilities will
shift to more complex rate structures. Netzero will help you navigate these changes and reduce your
energy costs.

We will also continue publishing research based on anonymized Netzero data. Our recent
[Powerwall Battery Retention analysis](https://www.netzero.energy/content/2025-02/powerwall-analysis)
is the first of many planned reports.


## Frequently Asked Questions

**When do I need to subscribe?**

Starting **August 1, 2025**, existing users will require a subscription for advanced features. You
will receive an in-app reminder. To avoid interruption of automations, subscribe before that date.
New users get a **30-day free trial** and will need to subscribe to maintain access to advanced
features.

Note: the subscription is activated the moment your purchase it, and will renew after a month (or
after a year for annual subscriptions).

Subscriptions are available in Netzero app version 2.1.0 and above. To subscribe, go to
**Settings > Subscription**.

---

**What if I use multiple mobile devices or have several Tesla systems?**

Subscriptions are tied to Tesla accounts. One subscription covers all your devices (Android/iOS/web)
and up to three energy systems linked to the same Tesla account.

Note: subscriptions can only be activated through the mobile app (iOS or Android). If you primarily
use the web app, you will need to log in on a mobile device once to activate the subscription.

---

**Where are subscriptions available?**

Subscriptions are currently available in United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany,
New Zealand, Italy, Canada, Portugal, Netherlands, and Spain. Users in unsupported countries can
continue using advanced features for free until support is added.

Note: availability is based on your App Store / Google Play account region, which cannot be
changed manually.

---

**Can I cancel at any time?**

Yes. Subscriptions are managed via the App Store or Google Play and can be cancelled at any time.
Features will remain active until the end of the billing period.

---

**Is there a free version of the app?**

Yes. Dashboards, historical charts, solar estimates, Developer API and enhanced data downloads
remain free. Only advanced features (automations, dynamic tariffs, utility integrations, and
diagnostics) require a subscription.

---

**Why is the price in my currency higher than the USD price after exchange rate?**

App Store prices are set using Apple's predefined pricing tiers, which are based on historical
exchange rates and include local taxes such as VAT. These tiers are not updated in real time
with currency fluctuations. For example, in the UK, a 20% VAT is included in the listed price.
As a result, even if the USD and local prices seem unequal after conversion, the difference is
typically due to VAT and Apple's use of fixed pricing tiers rather than current exchange rates.

---

**Why not offer a one-time purchase instead of a subscription?**

Netzero incurs ongoing costs: cloud infrastructure costs, Tesla API charges, and development and
support cost. For now, a subscription model better reflects these continuing expenses.

To reduce payment frequency, consider the annual plan (16% cheaper). We may consider one-time
purchases in the future when we get more data on subscription use.

---

**Why would I pay for Netzero when I can use Home Assistant for free?**

We're big supporters of open-source development, and have contributed to the community by helping
unlock Powerwall 3 diagnostics access. Home Assistant is a great alternative, however not entirely
free -- it requires time to set up and configure, some services for accessing the Tesla Fleet API
are paid as well, it runs on a computer that needs to be powered 24/7 for automations to run, and
cloud access to Home Assistant in an additional charge.

---

**What if I choose not to subscribe?**

You'll still have access to the core features of Netzero, including dashboards, solar forecasts,
and data exports. Advanced features like automations, dynamic tariffs, utility integrations, and
diagnostics will pause, but they won't be deleted.

If you decide to subscribe later, everything will pick up right where you left off -- your
automations will resume automatically and your settings will remain intact.
