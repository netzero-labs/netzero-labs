# Netzero - EV Charging Automation

## Introduction

[Netzero](https://www.netzero.energy) automations enable starting or stopping EV charging. This requires a
Tesla vehicle or OCPP-compatible EV charger. See
[EV Charger Settings](https://www.netzero.energy/docs/ev_charger_settings) for how to configure
your Tesla vehicle or charger.


## Examples

Below are some suggested automations for EV charging:

- If you are on a dynamic pricing plan, you might want to only charge the EV when grid import prices
  are low:
  ```
  When electricity price is below $0.20, start charging.
  When electricity price is at or above $0.20, stop charging.
  ```

- You might want to only start charging the EV after the Powerwall is full:
  ```
  When Powerwall is charged up to 100%: Start vehicle charging.
  ```

Charging based on a schedule is also possible, but most EV chargers and EVs already support this feature.

## Notes

- Since Tesla recently started charging for waking up the car or issuing commands, the automations
  are limited to 5 per user in a 24 hour period. This limit is across all start and stop
  automations. Once the allotted automations are exceeded, they will fail until enough time has
  passed.

- There are no limits for charging with an OCPP-compatible EV charger. Note that Tesla Wall
  Connector is not OCPP-compatible.

- EV charging can only start if the vehicle is plugged in and ready to be charged.
  Similarly, the vehicle has to be actively charging for a stop automation to succeed.
