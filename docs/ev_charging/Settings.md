# Netzero - EV Charger Settings

## Introduction

[Netzero](https://www.netzero.energy) automations enable configuration changes for Powerwall systems based
on EV charging status. For example, you can configure your Powerwall to preserve charge when EV charging
starts and avoid discharging the Powerwall into the (much larger) EV battery.

Depending on your EV charging setup, there are different ways for Netzero to determine charging status. There
are integrations for **Tesla Wall Connectors**, **Tesla vehicles**, and **OCPP-compatible EV chargers**
(e.g. Wallbox or Zappi). If your charging setup is not currently supported, send us an email to
feedback@netzero.energy and we'll look at adding support.

To configure your EV charger, navigate to `Settings / Vehicle Charging`. Once the charger is configured,
a new tab labeled `EV Charging` show up on top of the `New Automation` screen. This tab can be used to
configure automations based on the start or stop of EV charging.

Note: in the future, we're also planning on enabling automations that automatically start or stop
EV charging, for example based on electricity pricing or solar production.

## Tesla Wall Connector

If you have a Gen 3 Tesla Wall Connector (Wi-Fi enabled Wall Connector), that's a simple and
reliable way for Netzero to determine charging status.

If necessary, add the Wall Connector to your energy system in the Tesla app by selecting the product
drop-down in the top left and selecting `Add Product`. Once the Wall Connector is successfully added
to your energy system, you should see a car garage on the main energy screen in the Tesla app.

No further setup is required in Netzero to access the Wall Connector data. You can confirm the status
on the `Settings / Vehicle Charging` screen.

### Notes

- The Wall Connector cannot currently be controlled remotely, so Netzero will not be able to start or stop
  EV charging based on this integration (once this feature is available). Look at the Tesla vehicle
  or OCPP-compatible charger integration for that.

## Tesla Vehicle

If you have Tesla vehicles, you can configure access so Netzero can track charging status. Note: Netzero will
only access charging information; it will not access location or any other vehicle data that's not related to
charging.

If necessary, add permissions so Netzero can access the data. Navigate to the `Settings / Vehicle Charging`
screen and follow the app instructions to enable the **Vehicle Information** and
**Vehicle Charging Management** permissions. Once the permissions are added and refreshed in the app,
vehicle status will appear in the settings.

### Notes

- Because Netzero does not access location information, the Tesla vehicle integration may have
  limitations in reliably determining home charging (as opposed to charging on the go). Fast charging
  can be determined and will be excluded from automations. However, when charging at a public Level 2
  charger, your automations may still trigger. We are working to improve the reliability of
  home charging detection in the future.

- This integration will allow Netzero to start or stop EV charging in the future.

## OCPP-compatible EV charger

Some EV chargers support OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol), an application protocol for communication
between EV chargers and central management systems (providers).  If your EV charger is compatible,
you can configure Netzero as the provider. This integration will share the EV chargerâ€™s status and
allow remote control.

Examples of compatible chargers include Wallbox and Zappi. If your charger is compatible, you will
see an OCPP configuration option in its app. Configure it using the following settings:

```
Provider: wss://ocpp.netzero.energy
Charge point ID: ABCD-1234 (replace with the value shown in the Netzero app)
```

No password is required.

### Notes

- The Wallbox and Zappi integrations have been tested. If you experience issues with a different
  brand of OCPP-compatible EV charger, please contact us at feedback@netzero.energy.

- This integration will allow Netzero to start or stop EV charging in the future.
