# Netzero - EV Charger Settings

## Introduction

[Netzero](https://www.netzero.energy) automations enable configuration changes for Powerwall systems based
on EV charging status. For example, you can configure your Powerwall to preserve charge when EV charging
starts and avoid discharging the Powerwall into the (much larger) EV battery.

Depending on your EV charging setup, there are different ways for Netzero to determine charging status. There
are integrations for **Tesla Wall Connectors**, **Tesla vehicles**, and **OCPP-compatible EV chargers**
(e.g. **Wallbox** or **myenergi zappi**).

To configure your EV charger, navigate to `Settings > Vehicle Charging`. Once the charger is configured,
you use the `EV Charging` tab on top of the `New Automation` screen to configure automations based
on the start or stop of EV charging.

Note: in the future, we're also planning on enabling automations that automatically start or stop
EV charging, for example based on electricity pricing or solar production.

## Tesla Wall Connector

If you have a Gen 3 Tesla Wall Connector (Wi-Fi enabled Wall Connector), that's a simple and
reliable way for Netzero to determine charging status.

If necessary, add the Wall Connector to your energy system in the Tesla app by selecting the product
drop-down in the top left and selecting `Add Product`. Once the Wall Connector is successfully added
to your energy system, you should see a car garage on the main energy screen in the Tesla app.

No further setup is required in Netzero to access the Wall Connector data. You can confirm the status
on the `Settings > Vehicle Charging` screen.

### Notes

- The Wall Connector cannot currently be controlled remotely, so Netzero will not be able to start or stop
  EV charging based on this integration (once this feature is available). Look at the Tesla vehicle
  or OCPP-compatible charger integration for that.

## Tesla Vehicle

If you have a Tesla vehicle, you can configure access so Netzero can track its charging status. Note: Netzero will
only access charging information; it will not access location or any other vehicle data that's not related to
charging. It does not have access to unlock or start your vehicle, or camera access. It will also not wake
up your vehicle to get the charging status.

Charging status is tracked using [Tesla Fleet Telemetry](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/fleet-telemetry),
a secure way for Tesla vehicles to report specific data to third-party services such as Netzero. The
initial setup requires a few more steps:

1. If necessary, add permissions so Netzero can access vehicle data. Navigate to the `Settings > Vehicle Charging`
screen and follow the app instructions to enable the **Vehicle Information** and
**Vehicle Charging Management** permissions. Once permissions are added, return to the app and refresh
the state. If you had already added permissions when first logging in with Netzero, you will skip this step.

2. Set up a [Virtual Key](https://www.tesla.com/_ak/api.netzeroapp.io) for Netzero, a secure connection
to your vehicle. The key can be revoked if required. Netzero does not have permission to unlock or
start your vehicle. Note: if you are not the owner of the vehicle, you will to be in the vehicle with
a Tesla key card when completing this process. Older Tesla Model S and X vehicle do not support
Fleet Telemetry.

3. Once the key is set up, Fleet Telemetry will be automatically configured and the vehicle will
start reporting its charging status.


### Notes

- Because Netzero does not access location information, the Tesla vehicle integration has some
  limitations in reliably determining home charging (as opposed to charging on the go). Fast charging
  can be determined and will be excluded from automations. However, when charging at a public Level 2
  charger, your automations may still trigger. We are working to improve the reliability of
  home charging detection.

- This integration will allow Netzero to start or stop EV charging in the future.


## OCPP-compatible EV charger

Some EV chargers support OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol), an application protocol for communication
between EV chargers and central management systems (providers).  If your EV charger is compatible,
you can configure Netzero as the provider. This integration will share the EV chargerâ€™s status and
allow remote control.

Examples of compatible chargers include **Wallbox** and **myenergi zappi**. If your charger is compatible,
you will see an OCPP configuration option in its app. Configure it using the following settings:

```
Provider: wss://ocpp.netzero.energy/
Charge point ID: ABCD-1234 (replace with the "Charge point ID" shown in Netzero)
No password is required.
```

Here are example configuration screens for **Wallbox** and **myenergi zappi** (replace the ABCD-1234 part with the "Charge point ID" shown in Netzero):

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="ocpp-wallbox.png" width="400" alt="Wallbox OCPP Configuration" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="ocpp-zappi.png" width="400" alt="zappi OCPP Configuration" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Notes

- The **Wallbox** and **myenergi zappi** integrations have been tested. If you experience issues with a different
  brand of OCPP-compatible EV charger, please contact us at feedback@netzero.energy.

- If your EV charger only has a provider address field and no Change Point ID field (e.g. Fronius Wattpilot),
  append the ID to the end of the provider address, for example:
  wss://ocpp.netzero.energy/ABCD-1234 (replace with the "Charge point ID" shown in Netzero).

- This integration will allow Netzero to start or stop EV charging in the future.
